                        <div class="des1 revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">My name is Connie Zhao, I am a registered massage therapist and a registered acupuncturist. I have over 20 years of practical experience in each of these fields and have practiced in clinics across the world in counties like Japan, China and Canada. I learned the fundamentals and basics of Chinese medicine in China at the Northern Liao Ning Chinese Medicine College. I am a current member in good standing of both the CMTO (College of Massage Therapists of Ontario) and CTCMPAO (College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario). </div>

                        <div class="des2 revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">From my time in China to now I have acquired many new skills and techniques through constant self-learning and encounters with new patients. I have a genuine passion for Chinese medicine and am still learning everyday as I try to perfect my understanding of the long and rich history behind the art of Chinese medicine. I believe in providing the best care possible for my clients. Ensuring that they are in a warm and comforting environment during their treatment sessions is definitely a priority of mine.</div>

                        <div class="des3 revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">With regards to my practice techniques I strongly believe in a result oriented time efficient approach to the treatment of my patients. I am very flexible with regards to combining treatments and I will recommend whatever method I believe will be the most beneficial to my clients. More specifically, most of my treatments will involve a combination of several disciplines (massage, acupuncture, gua sha, cupping etc.) to ensure that the patient experiences an improvement in their condition after each session.</div>
